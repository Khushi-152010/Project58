        <p>My favorite hobby is to paint. I am 11 years old and am in the 5th standard. I love to paint because it is a very productive and healthy thing to do. Here are some other reasons of why I think painting is a good thing to do. Painting helps to expand creativity growth. Additionally, it helps to build problem-solving and fine motor skills. 
Painting provides stress relief and helps to relax after a long day.
Painting also helps keep an optimistic and positive attitude.
          Finally, painting nurtures emotional growth. </p>
